### A web lab about tables in HTML & CSS

This repository showcases my progress in web development through a series of projects and labs completed during my first year of study. One of the key skills I developed was learning how to read and process data from CSV files, which allowed me to dynamically display information on web pages. I also gained hands-on experience with essential CSS principles, including mastering CSS Grid to create flexible, responsive layouts.
