# Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset containing information about electric vehicle registrations.

## Project Overview

*   **Dataset:** Information on electric vehicles, including make, model, model year, electric range, and registration location.
*   **Analysis Performed:** Investigated trends in EV adoption, popular models, electric range, and manufacturers' market share.
*   **Presentation:** Findings from this analysis are also presented in a separate file (`Electric Vehicle Data Analysis`). This work was done with Josh Magnan.

## Setup: Creating a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

### For macOS/Linux

1.  Open Terminal.
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd path/to/your/project`
3.  Create virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
4.  Activate environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5.  Install packages: `pip install pandas matplotlib numpy jupyter`

### For Windows

1.  Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd C:\path\to\your\project`
3.  Create virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
4.  Activate environment:
    *   Command Prompt: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   PowerShell: `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
5.  Install packages: `pip install pandas matplotlib numpy jupyter`

## Running the Analysis

1.  Activate the virtual environment.
2.  Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
3.  Open `questions.ipynb`
4.  Run the cells in the notebook.

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When finished, run: `deactivate`
