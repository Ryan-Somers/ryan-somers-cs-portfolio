### Development Project I 
<p>
  
I contributed to the development of an authorization and authentication app called HIAAA with my team, built using ASP.NET Core 8.0 and MVC. I was responsible for implementing a feature that allows applications to be created, removed, and updated within the system. Additionally, I developed the functionality for assigning App Admins to these applications, ensuring that each app has the appropriate administrative oversight. Although we have made significant progress, the application is not yet complete, and we will be continuing its development in Development Project II.
