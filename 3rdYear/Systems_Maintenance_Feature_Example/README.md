### Systems Maintenance

<p>
  I contributed to my team's maintenance project for the Heritage Faculty Association (HFA) app, which ensures that the faculty of Heritage College receive important union news. My role involved adding mobile support across the majority of the application to improve accessibility and user experience on mobile devices. Additionally, I helped integrate authentication through the AMS (Authentication Management System) app to ensure secure access to the platform, enhancing the overall functionality and security of the application.
