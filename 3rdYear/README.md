My projects in this folder:
- An E-Commerce online store made with ASP.NET Core 8.0 and MVC & a React version for the manager. This store sells clothing and accessories that the customer can checkout and "buy". It also has a manager and clerk view so that they can manage their inventory of products. 
- A technical summary of image recognition in autonomous vehicles.
- An example of how I helped my team build a feature for the Development Project I course.
- An example of how I helped my team build a feature for the Systems Maintenance course.
